### Glossary
* FictionBook (also FeedBook) - the format for presenting electronic versions of books in the form of XML documents, where each element of the book is described by its own tags.
* Portable Document Format (PDF) is a cross-platform open electronic document format, originally developed by Adobe Systems using a variety of PostScript language features.
* EPUB is an open file format for electronic books developed by the International Digital Publishing Association (IDPF). The text, made in this format, automatically adapts to the screen size of a smartphone, laptop or e-book reader.

### 1\. Intoduction <a name="1"></a>
There are many programs for reading books under the Android system, but most of them significantly load the system due to the large consumption of resources, and this is perhaps one of the most important qualities.

And what if you create an application in which there will be no ads and which will be slightly loaded with various skins and add-ons, as well as reading all the popular formats of books? The answer to this question is just this project - BookReader.

### 2\. User Requirements <a name="2"></a>
#### 2.1\. Software Interfaces <a name="2.1"></a>
The project uses the Java programming language and does not interact with external systems and services.
#### 2.2\. User Interfaces <a name="2.2"></a>
The projectâ€™s graphical user interface is presented using mockups [Menu Bar(https://github.com/DaniilPshenichny/BookReader/blob/master/docs/ProjectDocumentation/Mockups/Menu%20bar.png), [The way to select a book](https://github.com/DaniilPshenichny/BookReader/blob/master/docs/ProjectDocumentation/Mockups/Book%20choice.png),[Function to share](https://github.com/DaniilPshenichny/BookReader/blob/master/docs/ProjectDocumentation /Mockups/Share%20bar.png) and [Example  of reading a book](https://github.com/DaniilPshenichny/BookReader/blob/master/docs/ProjectDocumentation/Mockups/Book%20reading.png).
Separate consideration is required by the menu tab:

Key | Reaction
--- | ---
"Current book" | The last book opened by the user opens.
"Library" | The window for selecting a book from the library opens.
"About app" | Developer Information Tab
"Night mode" | Slider to enable the night mode of the application
"Share" | Key to share information about the application

Target audience:
* Users who need a functional application for reading books under the Android system without ads.
#### 3\. System Requirements <a name="3"></a>
Run the application on the following operating systems:
* Android OS
#### 3.1\. Functional Requirements <a name="3.1"></a>
